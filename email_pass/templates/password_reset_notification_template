Hello,

Due to password expiration timing, we regret to inform you that users passwords will need to be reset for applying the new policy. You will be sent another email with your temporarily assigned password, please perform the password update as like before.

Your username will be the same as your network username, upon initial login, we are requesting that you change your password.  To do this, please open a terminal window, and enter the following command:

passwd

You only need to login to either system to change your password as it is LDAP managed, though it is advisable to confirm that you can login to both systems.

 
Please remember that this service is only for access to the workstations GUI via xRDP.  If you have questions, please contact admin support.





Thank you,
The xRDP admins
