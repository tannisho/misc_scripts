Hello,
 
Your xRDP user password is set to expire on August 24th, please login and update it before then. To do this, please login to one of the xrdp servers, open a terminal window, and enter the following command:
 
passwd
 
You only need to login to either one of the xrdp systems to change your password as they are LDAP managed, though it is advisable to confirm that you can login to both systems upon password change.
 
Please remember that this service is only for access to the GUI workstations via xRDP.  If you have questions, please contact admin support.
 
 
 
 
 
Thank you,
The xRDP admins
